# Eri's World
Gift for a friend - Simple RPG with one quest line

## Concept
<p>A player (My friend) will wake up on her birthday (yay!) but no one will be around. 
<br>She will travel around a small town looking for people, she will find items useful to her such as keys to unlock doors, or items she can wear (such as a party hat).
<br>After finding a few items she may meet a few NPCs that drop hints and with her happy birthday! Some might even have gifts for her.
<br>Eventually she will return home and find that her friends have planned a surprise for her, celebrating with streamers and cake and dancing!</p>
